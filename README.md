A short description of the project:

Our game is a 2D platformer where the player tries to kill the AI.
This is a game where the player is the boss and the AI adapts to their patterns.
It will have pixel/sprite graphics and will be programmed primarily in Python.
The defining feature of this game entails that the AI learns your moves and
eventually either you improve or let the AI get to you.Each time the AI improves,
we give the player a chance by improving the playerâ€™s statistics.

2. Once downloaded, open your terminal (cmd or bash) and change your current directory to the downloaded repo of the game.
3. Then you can test our game by running "python main.py" or "python3 main.py"

Changing the Codebase
1. Create or sign into a GitHub account.
2. Clone our game repo at https://github.com/Kdhngoa/rogue-robot-rambo onto your local machine. Either ssh or https is fine.
3. Open the local repo with your desired text editor.
